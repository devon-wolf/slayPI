# slayPI
A basic RESTful API serving up characters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Written in TypeScript and JavaScript, using Express for its endpoints, Superagent for its requests, and Cheerio for scraping/parsing those requests. Postgres is used for the database, and tests use Jest and Supertest.

Scrapes data from the Fandom.com Buffy wiki [here](https://buffy.fandom.com).

I used [yaycub](https://github.com/yaycub)'s and [mehtaphysical](https://github.com/mehtaphysical)'s [Animal Crossing Villager API] as a guide for how to use Cheerio - if you see this, thank you!

Under construction!
